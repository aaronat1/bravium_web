    faq: {
      title: "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)",
      q1_title: "How does this differ from a digital signature on a PDF?",
      q1_text: "It's a fundamental difference in where the trust lies: A digital signature on a PDF stores the proof of validity within the file itself. If the company that issued the signature certificate disappears, verification can become complicated. A Bravium certificate creates a cryptographic proof outside the file and anchors it permanently on a public blockchain. The proof does not depend on us or anyone else; it is a public, immutable record verifiable by anyone, forever. It's like having a notary seal in a global registry book, rather than just a signature on paper.",
      q2_title: "Do my users need to download an app or have a digital wallet?",
      q2_text: "No, and that's the main advantage of our system. There is no friction for the end-user. Your users receive a unique link or a QR code. By opening it in any browser (mobile or desktop), they access a public verification page where they can see the authenticity of the certificate instantly. It works on any device without needing to install anything.",
      q3_title: "What exactly is the 'blockchain' and why do you use it?",
      q3_text: "Think of the blockchain as a digital ledger or notary record that is public and cannot be erased or altered. We use it because it offers immutability. When we seal the proof of a document, it is permanently recorded on thousands of computers around the world. This ensures that the proof of authenticity of your document cannot be manipulated or deleted by anyone, not even us.",
      q4_title: "Are my original files uploaded to the blockchain? Are they public?",
      q4_text: "No, absolutely not. This is a crucial distinction. We never upload your original file (the PDF, image, etc.) to the blockchain. What we do is create a unique 'digital fingerprint' of that file (a hash). Only that small fingerprint, which contains no sensitive information, is what gets sealed on the blockchain. Your original file is stored securely in our encrypted infrastructure (Firebase Storage), and you have full control over it.",
      q5_title: "Is it complicated to implement in my organization?",
      q5_text: "Not at all. Bravium is designed for simplicity. To issue certificates, you can use our web dashboard. If you know how to use an online platform, you can start in minutes. To issue at scale, you simply upload a CSV file with the data of your hundreds or thousands of recipients. For developers, we offer a well-documented API so you can integrate certificate issuance directly into your own applications and workflows.",
      q6_title: "How secure is the system?",
      q6_text: "Security is divided into two layers: The Platform: Bravium is built on the secure and scalable infrastructure of Google Cloud, ensuring the protection of your data and that of your users. The Proof: The security of the certificate itself does not depend on us, but on the global blockchain network. The cryptographic proof is, by design, tamper-proof and is secured by a massive decentralized network, offering the highest possible level of trust.",
