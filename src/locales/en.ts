        q2_title: "Do my users need to download the Bravium app?",
        q2_text: "No, and that's the beauty of our system. We use open standards. Your users can use digital wallets they already know and trust, like Apple Wallet, Google Wallet, or Microsoft Authenticator, to store their credentials.",
        q3_title: "Is it complicated to implement?",
        q3_text: "Not at all. Bravium is a SaaS solution. You don't need knowledge of blockchain or cryptography. If you know how to use a web platform, you can start issuing credentials in minutes. For deeper integrations, our API is fully documented.",
        q4_title: "How secure is it?",
        q4_text: "Security is our top priority. We use public key cryptography and integrate with Google Cloud KMS for key management, which means the signing keys are never exposed. The credentials are, by design, unforgeable."
